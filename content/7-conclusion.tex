\chapter{ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ}
\label{ch:ЗАКЛЮЧЕНИЕ}

In this work an approach for identification of trajectory anomalies in uncertain ST data was proposed and discussed. To perform an evaluation and implement the approach, the framework was developed. The source code of the implemented framework is available on GitHub repository \cite{online:mt_anomalies}. For solving the task of outliers detection the clustering approach was used as a basis, specifically agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm. To calculate the similarity and dissimilarity between trajectories and clusters, the LCSS distance was chosen. However, as it was mentioned in previous chapters, LCSS distance calculation becomes infeasible for long trajectories. For that reason the approximation of input trajectories using polynomial regression was performed. According to the evaluation results, the best accuracy of approximation is achieved while using the 3\up{th} and 4\up{th}-degree polynomial functions jointly. Thereby, clustering was performed on a filtered set of approximated input trajectories using key points for each of them. The accuracy of the performed clustering was evaluated using a DI index and is equal to $0.95$ value, which can be considered as a $good$ result.
\todo{Update after obtaining final results}

(In this work following results were achieved:)

As a result of this work following conclusions and deductions can be drawn:
\begin{itemize}
	\item approximation of short trajectories with a non-constant speed requires higher-order polynomial functions for approximation
	\item LCSS distance allows trajectories to be of different lengths, but becomes extremely computationally expensive and complex for trajectories with more that 11-12 trajectory points
	\item approximation using a polynomial regression works well with the trajectory data, since it is known in advance that spatial coordinates of a trajectory are functionally dependent on the time (according to principles of physics, speed, acceleration, etc.)
	
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Дальнейшее развитие}
Последующие исследования

The implemented algorithm is designed in an offline-learning manner, that means that models of normal trajectories are learned offline beforehand and are not updated with new upcoming data on an on-going basis. The future researches can include investigating an opportunity of updating normal trajectories database in order to make the framework more adaptable to actual traffic data.
